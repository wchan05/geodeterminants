\title{Joins a Column for Air Quality Index(AQI)}
\usage{
add_AQI(tib)
}
\arguments{
\item{tib}{A tibble of data containing addresses as \code{address} in characters
and any corresponding data. The tibble should at least include addresses in
proper format and year of diagnosis as \code{year}(until function
\code{keep_original_year()} is run which then \code{actual_year} and \code{year} exist)
for the most accurate data}
}
\value{
A tibble with columns \code{AQI} and \code{category_AQI} added to the data of
the input tibble
}
\description{
The \code{add_AQI()} function appends annual Air Quality Index (AQI) data from the
EPA county based annual dataset. It takes each county via the
\code{tidygeocoder} package \code{reverse_geocode()}, identifies the air quality index
corresponding to the EPA's county data, retrieves pollutant-specific
data for the specified year, and classifies each observation into a corresponding
health risk category as well as identifying the main pollutant. \href{https://www.epa.gov/outdoor-air-quality-data}{Data from}.
}
\details{
#' The AQI is a standardized value (ranging from 0 to 500) that reflects the level of air pollution and the potential health implications. It is calculated for key criteria pollutants:
\itemize{
\item Fine Particulate Matter (PM2.5, code = 88101)
\item Ozone (O3, code = 44201)
\item Carbon Monoxide (CO, code = 42101)
\item Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2, code = 42602)
\item Sulfur Dioxide (SO2, code = 42401)
}
For each pollutant, the function retrieves the annual arithmetic mean concentration and converts it into an AQI value using standard EPA breakpoints. The overall AQI for the address-year combination is defined as the \strong{highest} pollutant-specific AQI, representing the "main pollutant" and worst-case air quality exposure.

EPA AQI values are mapped to health-based categories as follows:
\describe{
\item{0–50}{Good — Air quality is satisfactory, and air pollution poses little or no risk.}
\item{51–100}{Moderate — Air quality is acceptable; some pollutants may be a concern for a very small number of individuals.}
\item{101–150}{Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups — People with respiratory or heart conditions, children, and older adults may be affected.}
\item{151–200}{Unhealthy — Everyone may begin to experience health effects; sensitive groups may experience more serious effects.}
\item{201–300}{Very Unhealthy — Health alert: everyone may experience more serious health effects.}
\item{301–500}{Hazardous — Health warnings of emergency conditions. The entire population is more likely to be affected.}
}
