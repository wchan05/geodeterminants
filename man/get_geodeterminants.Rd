\arguments{
\item{gd_tib}{\strong{Tibble} that must at least contain columns \code{address},
\code{state}(abbreviation for best use), and \code{year}(of diagnosis/source). This
tibble may also contain other patient data that will be preserved
throughout the function. Leave \strong{NULL} if data is in \emph{vector} form}

\item{gd_addresses}{\strong{Vector} named \code{addresses} that contains addresses of
patient/study subjects}

\item{gd_current_year}{The current year this function is being used}

\item{gd_minority_group_code}{The \code{B03002} table code of the minority group
of interest. If the code isn't known leave null and select from the menu.
\href{https://data.census.gov/table/ACSDT1Y2022.B03002}{source}}

\item{gd_comparison_group_code}{The \code{B03002} table code of the comparison
group of interest. If the code isn't known leave null and select from the
menu. \href{https://data.census.gov/table/ACSDT1Y2022.B03002}{source}}

\item{gd_minority_group_code_dhc}{The \code{P5} table code of the comparison group
of interest. If the code isn't known leave null and select from the menu.
Used when dates are 2020 and up. \href{https://www.census.gov/data/tables/2023/dec/2020-census-dhc.html}{DHC data}}

\item{gd_minority_group_code_sf1}{The \code{P005} table code of the comparison
group of interest. If the code isn't known leave null and select from the
menu. Used when dates are below 2020. \href{https://www.census.gov/data/datasets/2010/dec/summary-file-1.html}{sf1 data}}

\item{gd_current_fed_min_wage}{The current years minimum wage (e.g. current
year: 2025, $7.25)}
}
\value{
The \strong{original} input tibble with \strong{Social Determinants of
Health(SDOH)} data appended for each address if data is available
according to each determinants' function criteria
}
\description{
⚠️ \strong{Note:} Data must be in tibble or vector form, read parameter descriptions for formatting break down.
You must have these packages installed for use of this package/function.
\code{\link{Street}}, \code{\link{City}}, \code{\link{State}} \code{\link{Area Code}} format works best for address

Converts a vector or tibble of addresses and supplementary data into Census
tract and block identifiers using \pkg{tidygeocoder}, and appends
tract-level measures of social determinants of health (SDOH) from
authoritative public data sources (e.g. ACS and EPA). Designed for public
health and policy research, this function provides a interlinking workflow for
joining address-level data to environmental, socioeconomic, and
demographic indicators.

These packages must be installed for proper functionality:
\strong{tidyverse}, \strong{tidygeocoder}, \strong{tibble}, \strong{tidycensus}(API KEY), \strong{tigris}, \strong{sf}, \strong{readxl}

SDOH list that can be retrieved given strictly address data:
Air Quality Index, Concentrated Poverty, Educational Attainment – Community,
Environmental Justice, Food Swamp, Income Concentration, Minimum Wage,
Percent Unionized for Non-Agricultural Labor Force, Race/Ethnic Residential
Segregation – American Community Survey, Race/Ethnic Residential Segregation
– Separation (S) Index, Unbiased, Race/Ethnic Residential Segregation – U.S.
Census, Social Vulnerability
