\title{Joins a Column for Food Swamp: Retail Food Environment Index}
\usage{
add_RFEI(tib)
}
\arguments{
\item{tib}{A tibble of data containing addresses as \code{address} in characters
and any corresponding data. The tibble should at least include addresses in
proper format and year of diagnosis as \code{year}(until function
\code{keep_original_year()} is run which then \code{actual_year} and \code{year} exist)
for the most accurate data}
}
\value{
A tibble with column \code{RFEI} added to the data of the input tibble
}
\description{
The \code{add_RFEI()} function computes the Retail Food Environment Index (RFEI)
at the county level for each participant in a provided tibble, using store
and restaurant data from the \href{https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/food-environment-atlas/data-access-and-documentation-downloads}{USDA Food Environment Atlas}.
The index is calculated as the ratio of fast food and convenience stores to
grocery stores and supermarkets. Data is matched by year (\strong{2011} or
\strong{2016}), state, and cleaned county name. All values that will cause issues
due to NA are taken care of. The number indicates the times greater of
unhealthy food access. A higher RFEI has been correlated with a higher
obesity rate compared to a lower RFEI.
}
\details{
\deqn{RFEI = \frac{FFR + CONVS}{GROC + SUPERC}}
where:
\itemize{
\item \code{FFR} = Number of fast food restaurants (limited-service restaurants)
\item \code{CONVS} = Number of convenience stores
\item \code{GROC} = Number of grocery stores
\item \code{SUPERC} = Number of supermarkets
}
